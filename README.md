### Linear Regression on Flight Data
In this study, Flight Take Off Data from JFK Airport dated Nov 2019-December 2020 was examined and Linear Regression Model was applied. 

### Some of the questions I aim to answer in Exploratory Data Analysis are:
- Which month and day of the week had the highest number of flight delays?
- What was the number of flights based on taxi-out times?
- What was the delay percentage of flights?
- What were the top 10 weather conditions that caused delays?
- What was the relationship between tempereature and departure delay?
- What was the company ranking according to the average number of delays?
