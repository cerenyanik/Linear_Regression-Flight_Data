**Model**: Linear Regression

In this study, which includes Flight Take Off data, Exploratory Data Analysis was carried out in order to better understand the reasons for taxi-out causing high costs; and ***Linear Regression Model*** was applied.

#### Some of the questions I aim to answer in Exploratory Data Analysis are:
- Which month and day of the week had the highest number of flight delays?
- What was the number of flights based on taxi-out times?
- What was the delay percentage of flights?
- What were the top 10 weather conditions that caused delays?
- What was the relationship between tempereature and departure delay?
- What was the company ranking according to the average number of delays?

This dataset, which includes flights between November 2019 and December 2020, was taken from JFK Airport.
